Having to start games like Retal and Lemmings from the command line was enough challenge at the time, but when I later upgraded to Windows 3.1 I actually started tinkering with the computer a bit more.
My friends were however already using Windows 95 and played games like Sim City 2000, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and Magic Carpet.</description></item></channel></rss>
