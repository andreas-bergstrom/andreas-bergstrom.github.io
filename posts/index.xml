But there are still some details that could suprise you unless you are aware of them.</p>

<p>Because even though the Python runtime will take care of memory management, sometimes developers will want to manually tell the garbage colletor that a variable is no longer needed. Either because they are doing some edge-case optimization and really know what they are doing or they think they are smart but have no idea what they are doing. Most likely the latter as the Python runtime most often does not release unused memory back to the operating system.</p>

<p>But when someone need to somehow mark a variable as ready to be freed by the garbage collector, there are usually two solutions they come across:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span></code></pre></div>
or
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">x</span></code></pre></div></p>

<p>The difference is that <strong>x = None</strong> will free whatever it referenced but keep the name around even though it&rsquo;s just referencing None (which is a type, NoneType).</p>

<p>On the other hand <strong>del x</strong> will completely remove both the name and what it referenced. If you thereafter try to use x an NameError will be thrown (or AttributeError in case of a object property).</p>

<p>So in practice, by assigning None to a name you can still use it in expressions while using del the name is completely removed. In the first case a few bytes is needed to keep the name in memory, while the later completely clears all memory usage.</p>

<p>As you can see in the error above, if you for whatever reason need to hook into the memory management, unless you know the difference between assigning to None and using <strong>del</strong> it could confuse you.</p>
